# Web Development using Go with Jon Calhoun

This is my journey into GoLang. What better way than with a course by Jon, building a real world application.

I will be using this repo to share all the code that I have written using PRs, so that each time I commit you can see clearly what's been added and removed.
If you'd like to keep up to date then feel free to drop a follow too!


>Throughout the course you will be building LensLocked, a photo sharing application. Users can sign up, create galleries, and upload photos to create a gallery. After a gallery is completed it can be published, making it publicly accessibly to anyone with the URL.

>While building the application we will learn about uploading images, interacting with a PostgreSQL database, limiting access to resources you have permission to edit, and if you purchase one of the packages with bonus material we will also look at how to integrate with a third party API like Dropbox using OAuth.
